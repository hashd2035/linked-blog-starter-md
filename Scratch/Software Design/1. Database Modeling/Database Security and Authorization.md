# Introduction to Database Security

## Data Encryption
[Best Practices for Encrypting Data In Your Database](https://www.dbvis.com/thetable/best-practices-for-encrypting-data-in-your-database/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20data%20encryption%20refers,data%2Din%2Dtransit%20encryption)
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Use SSL/TLS protocols to secure data transmission
- Employ encryption algorithms (e.g. AES) to encrypt sensitive customer data stored in the database
- Ensure encryption key are properly managed and rotated
- Encryption is great, but, it will slow down the performance (by 30~40%)
## Strong authentication
- Enforce strong authentication methods for all users, including customers and employees
	- If you've sharded secure data in the database, make sure to give a role access to a particular group of users, only.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security
- Require regular password changes and ensure passwords are complex
- Store user credentials securely using cryptographic hashing
## Authorization and Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement RBAC to define roles (e.g. customer, employee, admin) and assign permissions accordingly
- Ensure that users only have access to the data and functionalities necessary for their roles
- Regularly review and update role assignments to align with organization changes
## Audit Trails and Logging
- Establish comprehensive audit trails and logging mechanisms to monitor database activity
- Log login attempts, data access and critical database operations
- Use tools and technologies for real-time monitoring and alerting
- Retain logs for an appropriate period to support forensic analysis
## Security Best Practices
- Regularly apply security patches and updates to the database management system and related software
- Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address weaknesses
- Educate employees about security awareness and provide training on security best practices.
