## What are interviewers looking for

Average (beginner) Developer 
- While they can create solution for smaller use cases, maybe they have not been exposed to all the use cases, so, they need other's help.
Good Developer 
* They take tasks independently and able to write small features and work with other senior engineers
**GREAT** Developer
* They can tackle any problem using up-to-date tools. And, that's not because they know everything, but, they have a good research skills. They are able to break down a problem into manageable pieces and then attack those in terms of doing research and coming up with proposals, tradeoff analysis, doing design reviews, being able to bring on the team on their side and then execute them

## Backend Databases Depth / Breadth

How to judge the qualities of a GREAT developer?
- Depth 
	- Understand, explain, and weigh the fundamental advantages / disadvantages of different databases
	- Had an experience in one or two database extensively
- Breadth - Familiar with or able to quickly research databases to solve any backend programming problem

## Interviewers generally care
- More About
	- Chosen language proficiency
	- <u>Approach to think about problems</u>
	- Knowledge of databases to solve problems
	- Deep technical knowledge of <u>database concepts</u>
	- The <u>questions you ask</u> (Clarification)
	- Non-Functional Requirements
- Less About
	- Choice of programming language
	- Experience with every database in their stack
	- Memorization ability
	- Years of experience
	- Tools and techniques on your resume
	- Providing every detail you need

## Methodical Interview Approach
When approaching a database design problem during FAANG or any interview we must highlight crucial salient points of our understanding of engineering and how it relates to technical and strategic business requirements at hand.

### What FAANG Interviewers Look For

- Understand Requirements - P0
	- assessing what is feasible and what is not, push back when some tasks are not technically feasible.
	- offering recommendation for improving the requirements
- Critical Thinking
	- Identify and analyze benefits and drawback of our design decisions in terms of databases anticipating various use cases, balancing performance with cost and reliability of your solution and really thinking about how each pieces of your system including databases will work together
- Articulate Reasoning
	- Show you thought critically about the opriov
	- You can describe and support your design decision in fron t iof cowoker
	- Pay attention to interviewer giving you hints and 
- Technical Knowledge
	- prove technical competency
	- study throughly whatever you write in you r resume
	- don't bring up anything you don't understand
	- If you're not 100% sure or you have not work with the technology, tell interviewer, you don't have an experince
		- Then your interviewer will give you another problem
		- Or, have you still try 
- Fault-Tolerant Design
- Scalable Design 
	- provide the scalable options
	- can be measured in 
		- volume of data
		- schema evolution (if the db is not flexible)
- Save Costs
	- Every database feature will cost you
	- Don't pick any feature you don't need
