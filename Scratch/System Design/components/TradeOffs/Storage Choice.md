## Characteristics of Different Databases
#### MongoDB
- uses leader-follower protocol, making it possible to use replicas for heavy reading.
- ensures atomicity in concurrent write operations and avoids collisions by returning duplicate-key errors for record-duplication issues.

### Cassandra, Riak, DynamoDB
- need read-repair during the reading stage and hence provide slower reads to write performance.
- They are leader-less NoSQL databases that provide weaker data consistency guarantees upon concurrent writes. Being a single leader database, MongoDB provides a higher read throughput as we can either read from the leader replica or follower replicas. The write operations have to pass through the leader replica. It ensures our systemâ€™s availability for reading-intensive tasks even in cases where the leader dies.
