## **Quorum Theory:**

- **Guarantee Availability:** This theory helps ensure data availability in a distributed system even when some replicas are unavailable due to failures or network issues.
- **Read and Write Quorums:** It defines two sets of replicas: a read quorum and a write quorum.
- **Read Quorum:** The minimum number of replicas a successful read operation must access to guarantee retrieving consistent data. Even if some replicas are unavailable, as long as the read quorum is met, the system can still deliver a valid response.
- **Write Quorum:** The minimum number of replicas a successful write operation must update to ensure the change is persisted consistently across the system. This quorum needs to be larger than the read quorum to avoid inconsistencies.

## **3 Replicas for Reads (Why it Works):**

- **Availability:** With 3 replicas, even if 1 replica is unavailable, a read operation can still access the remaining 2 replicas to retrieve data, as long as those 2 are part of the read quorum. This ensures high read availability.

## **4 Replicas for Writes (Why it Works):**

- **Consistency:** With 4 replicas, a write operation needs to update at least 3 replicas (write quorum) to be considered successful. This helps ensure that even if 1 replica fails after the write, the remaining 2 updated replicas guarantee the change is reflected in the majority, preventing inconsistencies.

## **So, why might it not always be 3 and 4?**

- **Trade-offs:** The choice of quorum size involves a trade-off between availability and consistency. More replicas improve availability (higher read quorum) but can decrease write performance (larger write quorum).
- **Specific Needs:** Depending on the application requirements, you might prioritize availability (higher read quorum) or consistency (larger write quorum).
- **More Complex Scenarios:** Some systems might use different quorum sizes for reads and writes, or even employ a more granular approach with multiple read quorums depending on the consistency level desired for a specific read operation.

## **Conclusion:**

The 3-replicas-for-reads and 4-replicas-for-writes rule provides a good starting point for ensuring availability and consistency in a distributed system using quorum theory. However, it's crucial to consider your application's specific needs and adjust the quorum sizes accordingly to balance availability and consistency requirements.
