A **<u>spurious wakeup</u>** occurs when a thread is awakened from a wait on a condition variable even though the condition has not been signaled. Spurious wakeups can occur for a variety of reasons, such as hardware interrupts or other threads signaling the condition variable unintentionally.

To handle spurious wakeups, threads should always recheck the condition after being awakened from a wait. This can be done using a while loop, as shown in the following example:

```java
while (!condition) {  
	condition.wait();
}
```

In this example, the thread will wait on the condition variable until the condition is signaled. However, even after being awakened, the thread will recheck the condition to make sure that it has actually been signaled. If the condition is not signaled, the thread will go back to waiting.

Spurious wakeups can be a nuisance, but they are a fact of life when using condition variables. By rechecking the condition after being awakened, threads can avoid being misled by spurious wakeups.

Here are some additional tips for handling spurious wakeups:

- Use a timeout when waiting on a condition variable. This will prevent the thread from waiting indefinitely for a signal that may never come.
- Use a lock to protect the condition variable. This will prevent other threads from signaling the condition variable while the thread is waiting.
- Use a fair lock when protecting the condition variable. This will ensure that all threads waiting on the condition variable have an equal chance of being awakened.
