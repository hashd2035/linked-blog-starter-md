> Is it safer to say that for horizontal scaling for stateless servers, load balancer is used, for horizontal scaling for database layer, leader election with partitioning to shards are used, and for other stateful servers, consensus algorithms are used

That's a good summary, but there are a few refinements to consider for a more accurate picture:

## Stateless Servers

- **Load Balancers:** Absolutely! [[Load balancers]] are the primary mechanism for horizontal scaling stateless servers. They distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and high availability.

## Database Layer

- **Leader Election with Sharding (Partitioned Databases):** This is a valid approach, but it's not the only option. Here's a breakdown:
    - **Leader Election with Sharding:** This works well for smaller deployments or specific use cases. However, for very large-scale databases, it can still become a bottleneck and introduce complexity.
- **Distributed Databases:** Many modern database systems are designed for horizontal scaling. They handle data partitioning and replication internally, often using consensus algorithms or variations to ensure consistency across nodes. This eliminates the need for manual sharding and leader election.

## Other Stateful Servers

- **Consensus Algorithms:** This is an excellent choice for horizontally scaling other stateful servers that require strong consistency guarantees. Paxos and Raft are popular examples.

Here's a revised conclusion that incorporates these refinements:

## Horizontal Scaling Approaches

- **Stateless Servers:** Use [[load balancers]] to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- **Database Layer:**
    - For smaller deployments or specific use cases, consider <u>leader election</u> with [[Sharding, Database Partitioning|Sharding]] (partitioned databases).
    - For large-scale deployments, leverage distributed databases with built-in horizontal scaling features.
- **Other Stateful Servers:** Consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft are a powerful option for horizontally scaling stateful servers with strong consistency requirements.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The best approach depends on factors like data size, access patterns, desired consistency level, and system complexity. Consider the trade-offs between simplicity, scalability, and performance when making your decision.
