### Leader-Follower Design Pattern

**leader-follower** is a design pattern often used in distributed systems. 

In this pattern, one node is designated as the "leader" and the rest are "followers". 

The leader is responsible for managing and coordinating tasks, while the followers execute tasks assigned by the leader. 

The leader-follower pattern can help simplify the design of distributed systems by centralizing control in the leader.

### The leader-follower pattern is often used in distributed systems to manage replicas and handle heavy read loads.

In this pattern, the leader is responsible for handling all write operations to ensure data consistency. When a write operation occurs, the leader updates its own copy of the data and then propagates these changes to its followers, which are replicas of the leader.

The followers, on the other hand, handle read operations. Because the followers are exact replicas of the leader, they can serve read requests just as well as the leader. By distributing read operations across multiple followers, the system can handle a much larger volume of read requests than if all requests had to be served by a single node.

This pattern can significantly improve the system's read scalability and performance. However, it also requires careful management to ensure that all replicas remain consistent with the leader, especially in the face of network partitions or other failures.
